# Monte Carlo
Monte Carlo is useful to estimate the properties of estimates. Assume that we have a population space with a defined process in it and we want to estimate parameters of the process. We can take samples and estimate those parameters. Further, we construct a sampling distribution. The problem with that is that we don't know the actual values of the parameters. What we can simulate the population process and derive samples from it. In this case we know actual values of estimated parameters, by construction. Hence, construction of sample distribution allows us to conclude if parameters are unbiased, consistent and estimate their variance.

# Variance Reduction Techniques

  1. control variates
  
    + It exploits information about the errors in estimates of known quantities to reduce the error in an estimate of unknown quantity. 
    + The idea is to speedup variance convergence, by doing more computations. This works because MC converges very slowly. To reduce Variance by a factor of 2 we need to perform 4*n computations. 
    + Let $Y_1, Y_2, Y_n$ be outputs from some replications. Now, for each replication we compute $X_i$. Assume that $E[X_i]$ is known. Then for any b: $Y_i(b) = Y_i - b(X_i-E[X])$. Then the sample mean $\bar{Y}(b) = \bar{Y} - b(\bar{X} - E[X]) = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}(Y_i - b(X_i - E[X]))$. As an estimator of $E[Y]$, the control estimato is unbiased because $E[\bar{Y}(b)] = E[\bar{Y} - b(\bar{X} - E[X]) = E[\bar{Y}] = E[Y]$
    + The variance: $Var[Y_i(b)] = \sigma^2_Y - 2b\sigma_X\sigma_Y\rho_{XY} + b^2\sigma^2_X = \sigma^2(b)$. The optimal coefficient $b^* = \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}\rho_{XY}$ Then $\frac{\bar{Y}-b^*(\bar{X}-E[X])]}{Var[\bar{Y}]}= 1 - \rho^2_{XY}$
    
* A few observations follow from this expression:
     +  With the optimal coefficient $b^*$  , the effectiveness of a control variate, as measured by the variance reduction ratio (4.4), is determined by the strength of the correlation between the quantity of interest $Y$ and the control $X$. The sign of the correlation is irrelevant because it is absorbed in
$b^*$.
    + If the computational effort per replication is roughly the same with and without a control variate, then (4.4) measures the computational speed-up resulting from the use of a control. More precisely, the number of replications of the Yi required to achieve the same variance as n replications of the control variate estimator is $n/(1 - \rho^2_{XY})$.
    + The variance reduction factor $n/(1 - \rho^2_{XY})$ increases very sharply as $|\rho_{XY}|$ approaches 1 and, accordingly, it drops off quickly as $|\rho_{XY}|$ decreases away from 1. For example, whereas a correlation of 0.95 produces a ten-fold speedup, a correlation of 0.90 yields only a five-fold speed-up; at $|\rho_{XY}|$ = 0.70 the speed-up drops to about a factor of two. This suggests that a rather high degree of correlation is needed for a control variate to yield substantial benefits.

* In derivative pricing simulations, underlying assets provide a virtually universal source of control variates. If $S(t)$ is an asset price then $e^{-rt}S(t)$ is a martingale
Then the control variate estimator is $\frac{1}{n} \sum^{n}_{i-1}(Y_i-b[S_i(T) - e^{rT}S(0)])$
If $Y= e^{-rT}(S(T)-K)^+$
* Any martingale with a known initial value provides a potential control variate precisely becasue its expectation at any future time is its initial value.
* Options or Bonds could potentially become control variates
* Every instrument that serves as a good hedge also seves as a good control variate, if it can be easily priced. Additionaly, dynamic hedge can remove all the variance assuming complete market and continuous trading.
 
 
 
  2. Antithetic variates
   *  The method of antithetic variates attempts to reduce variance by introducing negative dependence between pairs of replications. The most aplicable form is based on the observation that if $U$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ then $1-U$ is too. Hence, if we generate a path using as inputs $U_1, U_2, ... U_n$, we can generate a second path using $1-U_1, 1-U_2,..., 1-U_n$.
   *  The variables $U_i and 1-U_i$ form an antithetic pair in the sence that a large value computed from the first path could be balanced out by the value computed by the antithetic path, thus reducing the variance. 
   *  This observations extend to other distribution through the inverse transform method: $F^{-1}(U)$ and $F^{-1}(-U)$ both have distribution $F$ but are antithetic to each other because $F^{-1}$ is monotone. In particular, if $Z_1, Z_2, ... Z_n i.i.d N(0,1)$ antithetic variables could be formed by  $-Z_1, -Z_2, ... -Z_n$. 
  3.	stratified sampling
      * Stratified sampling refers broadly to any sampling mechanism that constrains the fraction of observation drawn from specific subsets (or strata) of the sample space. Suppose, more specifically, that our goal is to estimate $E[Y]$ with Y real-valued, and let $A_1, ... A_K$ be disjoint subsets of the real line for which $P(Y \in \cup_iA_i)=1$. Then $E[Y] = \sum^K_{i=1}P(Y\in A_i) E[Y|Y\in A_i] = \sum^K_{i=1}p_iE[Y|Y\in A_i]$. In random sampling, we generate  independent $Y_i,..., Y_n$ having the same distributino as Y. The fraction of these samples falling in $A_i$ will not in general equal $p_i$, though it would approach $p_i$ as the sample size n increased. In stratified sampling, we decide in advance what fraction of the samples should be drawn from each stratum $A_i$; each observation drawn from $A_i$ is constrined to have the distribution of $Y$ conditional on $Y\in A_i$.
      * Stratifying nonuniform distributions.
        Let F be a CDF on the real line and let $$F^{-1}(u) = inf{x: F(x) <= u}$$ be its generalised inverse. Given probabilities $p_1,...,p_K$ summing to 1, define 
        $$a_0=-\infty, a_1 = F^{-1}(p_1), a_2 = F^{-1}(p_1+p_2), ..., a_k = F^{-1}(p_1+...+p_K)=F^{-1} (1)$$
