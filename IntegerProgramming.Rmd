*  An integer programming problem is an LP in which some or all of the variables are required to be non-negative integers. LP relaxation of the IP is the LP obtained by ommiting integer constrains.
*  The feasible region fro any IP must be contained in the feasible region fro the corresponding LP relaxation. Optimal z-value for LP relaxation $\geq$ optimal z-value for IP.
